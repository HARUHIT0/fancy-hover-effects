##Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create a loading animation when your cursor is hovering over the object. We will not be using JavaScript in this project.

## Project Structure

Create a project directory and set up the following file structure:
```plaintext
simple-website/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
```

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Create the HTML File

Open your code editor and create a file named `index.html`. Add the following code:

```html
!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>On Hover Spinner</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```
### 2. Create the CSS File

Create a file named `styles.css` and add the following code to style your webpage:

```css
body {
  
}
```
 

### 3. Link the CSS

Ensure that the CSS and JavaScript files are linked correctly in your `index.html` file. The `<link>` tag for CSS should be inside the `<head>` section, and the `<script>` tag for JavaScript should be just before the closing `</body>` tag.

### 4 Adding the div classes



### 5. Open the HTML File in a Browser

Open your `index.html` file in a web browser to see your simple website in action.

## Things to Look Out For

- Ensure the file paths in the `<link>` and `<script>` tags are correct.
- Use proper HTML structure and semantics.
- Keep your CSS organized and use meaningful class names.
- Test your website in different browsers to ensure compatibility.

## Stretch Goals
If you finish early, feel free to make changes with the color, the shape of the object, and the speed of the animation.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've created a loading animation using HTML and CSS. This is just the beginning – there are many more features and technologies to explore. Keep learning and experimenting to build more complex and dynamic websites.
